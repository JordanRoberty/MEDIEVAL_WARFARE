# MEDIEVAL WARFARE

## Presentation

Medieval Warfare is a mix between a shoot 'em up, a 2D platformer and a beat them all.

In this video game, you evolve through several linear levels where you have to face a multitude of enemies before being able to measure yourself against bosses.
The money collected during the levels allows you to improve your stuff through the purchase of different kinds of runes.

The game takes place in a dark-medieval-futuristic-fantasy universe, in a pixel art style. It will be playable on PC (Windows, Linux and MacOS) with controller or keyboard/mouse.

Whether you are nostalgic for old arcade games, looking for challenge (different difficulty modes are available), or a casual gamer, we are sure Medieval Warfare will be fun to play!
